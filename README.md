amber99sb-ildn.ff : Amber 99 SB ILDN force field with added parameters from GAFF.

**Simulation Files**

Simulations are in compressed .pdb.zip format with the labeling corresponding to the Table 1 in the main paper. In order to comply with the size allowance of GitHub, GROMACS trajectories that were recorded at 10 ps time intervals are increased to 100 ps time intervals for 200 ns simulations and to 500 ps time intervals for 1 micro second simulations. Trajectories are converted to pdb format with no water molecules and ions and compressed to individual zip files. Uncompressed simulation files can be visualized in VMD.
